# ü•ó Meal Planning Optimization with Differential Evolution

This project is a FastAPI-based backend for generating weekly meal plans optimized to match specific nutritional targets (calories, protein, fat, and carbs) using the **Differential Evolution (DE)** algorithm.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Generates a 7-day meal plan based on user-defined macronutrient goals
- Uses real-world food data from the USDA FoodData Central SR Legacy dataset
- Built with FastAPI for high performance and easy integration
- Supports CORS for frontend communication

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repo**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tarto2a/Fitness-app-withDE.git
cd Fitness-app-withDE
```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 
```

3. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the App

Start the FastAPI app using Uvicorn:

```bash
cd meal-planing-app
npm run back
```

start the fronend using Vite:

```bash
cd meal-planing-app
npm run front
```

You'll see an interactive Swagger UI where you can test the `/weekly-plan` endpoint.

## üì° API Usage

### `GET /weekly-plan`

**Query Parameters:**

| Name           | Type   | Default | Description                  |
|----------------|--------|---------|------------------------------|
| `target_calories` | float  | 2000    | Target daily calorie intake   |
| `target_protein`  | float  | 100     | Target daily protein (g)     |
| `target_fat`      | float  | 70      | Target daily fat (g)         |
| `target_carbs`    | float  | 250     | Target daily carbohydrates (g)|

**Example:**
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/weekly-plan?target_calories=1800&target_protein=90&target_fat=60&target_carbs=200
```

## üìä Dataset

- Source: [USDA FoodData Central SR Legacy](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/)
- Converted to JSON and categorized into: **Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack**

## üß† Algorithm

The optimization is powered by **Differential Evolution**, which evolves a population of meal plans across generations to minimize nutritional deviation from the target vector.
